### Welcome to my readme.MD!

First things off. I'm kinda careless and I upload video whenever i wanted to.
I ain't using social media much besides YouTube and Discord. 

I watched Anime and read mangas these days and I love it! especially The Quintessial Quintdruplets (五等分の花嫁)

Actually, I can't really use any resolution besides 1366x768 (WXGA), It's perfect. Possibly because I'm getting used to it. This time I'm trying to used using 1080p. which I'm really trying to, And using multiple monitors is a challenge. Well, I got a wide workspace but I used to minimize programs i open a lot to reducing lags (it's a habit)

And editing was my biggest nightmare ever, since it took time and effort. My [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPyCaRE0jtc) i made (as it is now) edited in two days, 1080p video was really fun to edit but it's killing my computer a little

I'll going to show you which software i use to make content
